# Introduction
In a country like India, increased population has increased the scope and probability for a person to get sick. But the number of employees in hospitals and other medical facilities has still been constrained due to lack of skilled labor and proper training. In such a place where number of service provider is less than the number of consumers. Either it leads to commotion or deprivation of facilities. This commotion further leads to poor data maintenance system. 
This flaw in the system can be removed only if the authorities concerned hire more number of skilled employees or they adopted a system which could replace these employees and lower the chances of human error.   
This software is meant to tackle with all of the mentioned solution. It software is created for a reception of a hospital, **LIFE HOPE HOSPITAL**, a imaginary name for ease of presentation. The software is self-sufficient in maintaining and keeping records fed by the user. It accepts all the details related to the patient and then uses it to generate the payable bill amount for a particular patient. It shows linked details of general information and billing history with the net bill created till date. This software can delete any existing database and can add a new one without creating any mess. One important feature is the option to reset the software and delete all the memory stored by the user in at once which is only accessible by the owner or any official with the master key code. Without this code no one would be able to wipe-out the data from the system.
